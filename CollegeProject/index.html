                        1. Alvin Martin once scored a hat-trick against three different goalkeepers
                        The defender achieved the feat playing for West Ham against Newcastle in 1986. His first goal
                        came against Martin Thomas, who was an actual keeper, but was forced off with injury. Martin
                        then scored against defender Chris Hedworth, who also injured himself meaning Peter Beardsley
                        was next. The Hammers won 8-1.

                        4. Clive Allen ended the 1979/80 season at QPR and began the following campaign at Palace,
                        after Arsenal had made him the costliest teenager in football during the summer
                        Having scored 28 goals for QPR in the Second Division, Arsenal paid £1.25m for Allen, but he
                        played three pre-season friendlies before being moved on to Selhurst Park. He later joined
                        Tottenham in 1984 and enjoyed huge success including scoring 49 goals in one season.
