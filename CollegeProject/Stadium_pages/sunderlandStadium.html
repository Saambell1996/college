            Sunderland Association Football Club, locally is an English
            professional football club based in the city of Sunderland, Tyne and
            Wear. Sunderland play in League One, the third tier of English
            football. Since its formation in 1879, the club has won six
            top-flight (First Division, now the Premier League) titles (1892,
            1893, 1895, 1902, 1913 and 1936), a total only bettered by five
            other clubs, and has finished runners-up five times. The club has
            also won the FA Cup twice (1937 and 1973) and been runners-up twice
            (1913 and 1992), as well as winning the FA Community Shield in 1936
            and being finalists the following year. Sunderland have also been
            Football League Cup finalists in 1985 and 2014.

            Sunderland won their first FA Cup in 1937 with a 3–1 victory over
            Preston North End, and remained in the top league for 68 successive
            seasons until they were relegated for the first time in 1958.
            Sunderland's most notable trophy after the Second World War was
            their second FA Cup in 1973, when the club secured a 1–0 victory
            over Leeds United. The team has won the second tier title five times
            in that period and the third tier title once. Sunderland play their
            home games at the 49,000-capacity all-seater Stadium of Light having
            moved from Roker Park in 1997. The original ground capacity was
            42,000 which was increased to 49,000 following expansion in 2000.
            Sunderland have a long-standing rivalry with their neighbouring club
            Newcastle United, with whom they have contested the Tyne–Wear derby
            since 1898.
